Chef Alex meticulously documented the sequential instructions for a new recipe, ensuring optimal culinary outcomes through systematic organization. However, during a busy period in the kitchen, the list became disorganized. As the instructions are now out of sequence, Alex requires assistance to restore them to their proper order.

The list may be corrected solely by removing a contiguous segment of instructions and reinserting it at any other location within the list. Each cut-and-insert operation incurs a fixed cost of one unit.

Determine the minimum number of cut-and-insert operations required to restore the shuffled list of instructions to their original sequence.

Constraints
1<= N <= 10

Input
First line contains a single integer N representing the number of instructions in the list

Next line contains the word "shuffled"

Output
Single Integer which represents the minimum cost to rearrange.
